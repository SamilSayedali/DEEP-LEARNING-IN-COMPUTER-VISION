The dataset employed in this study is designed for the development of a deep learning-based classification system for dermatoscopic skin lesion images. The primary objective is to construct an automated diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between malignant melanoma and benign nevus lesions. This binary classification task addresses a critical clinical challenge, as melanoma represents the most lethal form of skin cancer, with early detection being crucial for patient prognosis and survival rates. The automated system aims to serve as a supplementary diagnostic aid for dermatologists, facilitating timely intervention in melanoma cases.
